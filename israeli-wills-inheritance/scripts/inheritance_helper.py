"""Two deterministic checks for Israeli wills and inheritance.

Offline, stdlib-only. It does NOT give legal advice; it applies two black-letter rules
from the Succession Law so an agent does not get them backwards:

1. order  -- which inheritance order to request (succession, probate, or BOTH where the
   will covers only part of the property, Section 66(b)).
2. witness -- whether a proposed witness is disqualified under Section 35 because they,
   or their spouse, are a beneficiary of the will.

Exit codes: the witness check exits 1 when it finds a disqualified witness, a duplicate
witness, or fewer than two distinct witnesses, so a caller can branch on the result.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/inheritance_helper.py order --has-will yes
  python3 scripts/inheritance_helper.py order --has-will no
  python3 scripts/inheritance_helper.py order --has-will partial
  python3 scripts/inheritance_helper.py witness --beneficiaries "דנה כהן,יוסי לוי" \
      --beneficiary-spouses "רות לוי" --witnesses "השכן רון,ד״ר אבני"
