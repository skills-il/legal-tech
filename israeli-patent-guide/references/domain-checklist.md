# Domain Coverage Checklist: Israeli Patent Practice

This file is the explicit coverage contract for `israeli-patent-guide`. Every row is either covered by the skill, deliberately out of scope with a stated reason, or logged as a known gap. Re-litigate the "Out of scope" rows on every update cycle: a row that an ordinary user would plausibly ask for, or that has become capturable since the last cycle, must be reopened.

Last reviewed: 2026-08-01 (skill version 1.3.0)

## Out of scope (explicit) - re-litigate every cycle

| Topic | Reason | Verdict 2026-08-01 |
|---|---|---|
| Utility models | Israel has no utility model system. Nothing to describe. | **Keep out.** Structurally correct, not a coverage choice. |
| Copyright | No registration system in Israel; copyright arises automatically. Different statute, different advice shape. | **Keep out.** Would not change a filing decision. |
| Trademark registration and prosecution | Different statute (Trade Marks Ordinance 5732-1972) and different practice. | **REOPEN as routing only.** Same authority, same fee notice, and a founder asking how to protect a new product usually needs a brand mark too. Logged as a gap, not yet implemented. |
| Industrial design registration | Different statute (Designs Law 5777-2017, plus the old Designs Ordinance for pre-2018 registrations). | **REOPEN as routing only.** Designs carry a 12-month grace period where patents do not, so a founder who has already disclosed publicly may still have the design route open. This is a decision the skill currently cannot make for them. Logged as a gap. |
| Plant Breeders' Rights | Administered by a separate authority, not ILPO. | **Keep out.** Genuinely a different body. |
| Integrated Circuits (Protection) Law 5760-1999 | Rarely invoked; no registration procedure at ILPO. | **Keep out** for now, but note it exists if a hardware founder asks about mask works. |
| Litigation, infringement and enforcement strategy | Court practice, not prosecution. Requires litigation counsel. | **Keep out.** Correctly scoped. |
| Patent valuation, licensing and commercial terms | Commercial advice, not procedure. | **Keep out.** |
| Foreign national prosecution outside Israel | Jurisdiction-specific; unbounded scope. | **Keep out**, but the Israel-to-abroad routing decision is a logged gap. |


## Known gaps (logged, not yet implemented)

See `optimization-log.json` for the current cycle's carry list. In summary:

1. Patentability criteria and exclusions (ss.3 and 7) and Israeli software / business-method practice.
2. A protection-route chooser covering patent, registered design, trademark and trade secret.
3. The Israel-versus-abroad filing strategy decision (direct Paris route versus PCT, cost deferral, what PCT is not).
4. Calculator flags for the Section 18 Notice response deadline and the PCT Chapter II demand deadline.
5. Budapest Treaty biological deposits, relevant given the skill's biotech emphasis.
