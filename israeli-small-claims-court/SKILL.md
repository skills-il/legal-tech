## Examples

### Example 1: Filing for Unreturned Rental Deposit
**Input:** "My landlord won't return my NIS 8,000 deposit after the lease ended 3 months ago. What do I do?"
**Output:** Walk through the process: First, send a demand letter (mikhtav drishah) via registered mail giving the landlord 14 days to return the deposit. If no response, file a small claims case. The claim is well within the NIS 38,900 limit. Filing fee: 1% of NIS 8,000 = NIS 80. File at the court where the property is located. Prepare evidence: lease contract showing deposit terms, move-in and move-out photos, any communication about the deposit, and proof of the 60-day return period from the Fair Rental Law. The landlord must justify any deductions with documentation.

### Example 2: Defective Product Claim
**Input:** "I bought a NIS 3,500 washing machine that broke after 2 months and the store refuses to fix or replace it."
**Output:** Explain consumer rights: under the Consumer Protection Law, products must be fit for purpose. A washing machine failing after 2 months suggests a manufacturing defect. Steps: (1) Send a formal demand letter to the store citing the Consumer Protection Law. (2) If no resolution, file in small claims court where the purchase was made. Filing fee: NIS 50 (minimum). Evidence needed: purchase receipt, warranty card, photos or video of the malfunction, any correspondence with the store, and if possible a technician's report confirming the defect. Claim can include the product cost plus filing fee.

### Example 3: Self-Representation at the Hearing
**Input:** "I have a small claims hearing next week, how do I prepare?"
**Output:** Preparation checklist: (1) Organize all evidence in a folder with tabs and three copies (judge, defendant, yourself). (2) Write a brief timeline of events on one page. (3) Prepare a 3-5 minute opening statement covering: what happened, what you tried to resolve, and what you are claiming. (4) Anticipate the defendant's arguments and prepare counter-points. (5) Bring witnesses if applicable (notify them of the date). (6) Dress in business casual. (7) Arrive 30 minutes early to check in at the mazkirut (clerk's office). (8) Address the judge as "Kvod HaShofet." (9) Stay calm, be concise, and focus on facts, not emotions. (10) If the court offers mediation (gishur), consider accepting if a reasonable compromise is possible.

### Example 4: Enforcing a Judgment
**Input:** "I won my small claims case but the defendant hasn't paid. What now?"
**Output:** Explain the enforcement process: wait for the 30-day voluntary compliance period to expire. Then open an execution file (tik hotza'a lapo'al) at the nearest Execution Office. Bring the original judgment and your identification. Pay the opening fee (approximately NIS 50-100). The Execution Office will send the defendant a warning notice (azhara). If the defendant still does not pay, enforcement measures include: wage garnishment (ikul mishkoret), bank account seizure (ikul cheshbon bank), property liens (shi'abud), and potentially travel restrictions. The judgment amount will accrue interest from the ruling date. Many defendants pay after receiving the Execution Office warning.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Claim amount exceeds NIS 38,900"
Cause: The dispute involves more money than the small claims court limit.
Solution: You have three options: (1) Reduce the claim to NIS 38,900 and waive the excess (forfeiting the difference). (2) File in Magistrate Court (Beit Mishpat Shalom) which handles claims up to NIS 2.5 million (lawyer recommended but not required). (3) Split the claim if it involves genuinely separate transactions (not allowed for a single transaction). Consider whether the cost and complexity of Magistrate Court is worth the additional amount, as small claims is faster and simpler.

### Error: "Cannot locate the defendant's address"
Cause: Need a valid address to serve court summons.
Solution: Try these methods to find the defendant's address: check the original contract or invoice for address details. Search the Companies Registry (Rasham HaChevrut) if the defendant is a business. Use the Population Registry via a lawyer (requires legal authorization). Check online business directories or the defendant's website. If the defendant is a registered business, the registered office address is publicly available. The court clerk (mazkirut) may assist with service alternatives if the defendant cannot be located.

### Error: "Defendant filed a counterclaim (tvi'a negdit)"
Cause: The defendant is claiming money from you as part of the same dispute.
Solution: A counterclaim is common, especially in landlord-tenant and service disputes. You must respond to the counterclaim within 15 days, just as the defendant had to respond to your claim. Prepare evidence refuting the counterclaim. Both the original claim and counterclaim will be heard together in the same hearing. The judge will decide both claims. Do not panic; counterclaims are often a negotiation tactic. Focus on strengthening your original case with solid evidence.
