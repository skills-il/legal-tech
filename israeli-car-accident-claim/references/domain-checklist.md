# Domain Coverage Checklist, israeli-car-accident-claim

Generated: 2026-06-23, revised 2026-08-09 (v2) via research on: nevo.co.il (PLATD Law 1975, Insurance Contract Law, Limitation Law, Traffic Regulations), Traffic Ordinance PDF, gov.il accident-report service, kolzchut.org.il, insurer policy pages (clalbit, kalir, hcsra), Harel official accident-report form.

Sibling boundary: israeli-vehicle-manager (government-services) covers registration, test (טסט), used-car checks, ownership transfer, and choosing insurance, and explicitly excludes accidents and claims. This skill owns the accident and claim space and must cross-link, not duplicate.

## Must cover (core)

- [x] First-10-minutes scene checklist: secure safety (warning triangle, hazard lights), check for injuries, document everything, photograph all vehicles + damage + plates + road position + signage, exchange details with the other driver (name, ID, phone, plate, insurer + policy number), collect witness names and phones. Grounded in תקנה 144 / תקנה 145 detail-exchange duties.
- [x] The 3 insurance types and which to claim under: ביטוח חובה (compulsory) covers bodily injury only and is mandatory; ביטוח מקיף (comprehensive) covers your own vehicle's damage plus third-party property; ביטוח צד ג' (third-party) covers damage you cause to others' property, not your own. Map each damage type to the right policy.
- [x] No-fault bodily-injury regime (PLATD, חוק הפלת"ד 1975, Section 2(a)): for bodily injury, the injured party (driver, passengers, pedestrian) is compensated regardless of who caused the accident, by claiming under their OWN vehicle's compulsory insurance. This is the load-bearing fact; must contrast explicitly with property damage.
- [x] The allocation / carrier rule (PLATD Section 3): a driver and the passengers in a vehicle claim against that vehicle's own compulsory insurance; in a multi-vehicle crash each driver's own injury goes to his own vehicle's insurer; a pedestrian or cyclist claims against the vehicle that hit them. Must warn the user not to chase the other driver's compulsory insurer for their own injuries.
- [x] No-fault exclusions (PLATD Section 7): a person is not entitled to bodily-injury compensation if they caused the accident deliberately, drove without a valid licence (except a licence lapsed only for non-payment of the fee), drove without permission or a stolen vehicle, used the vehicle for a felony, or drove with no valid compulsory insurance. Must flag these as carve-outs to the no-fault rule.
- [x] Property-damage fault: unlike bodily injury, property liability IS fault-based. The at-fault driver or their insurer pays. Explain how a not-at-fault driver recovers (from the at-fault party's third-party cover, or from their own comprehensive then subrogation).
- [x] How to fill הודעה על תאונה: walk the standard insurer form's sections (insured and policy details, driver details, accident details with scene diagram and impact zones and witnesses, third-party details, the insured's declaration). Note it is ONE-SIDED, filed with your own insurer; Israel has no joint constat-amiable form.
- [x] Claim submission: notify the insurer immediately after the event (Insurance Contract Law Section 22; standard policy Section 27(a)), then submit the completed form plus photos, the police confirmation, and a damage assessment.
- [x] Time limits: report to the insurer immediately (מיד). TWO periods, never one: 3 years for a claim for insurance benefits against your own insurer, running from the insured event (Insurance Contract Law §31), and 7 years for the tort claim against the at-fault driver and for the PLATD bodily-injury claim (Limitation Law §5), with the minor's rule (§10). Plus the §70 liability-insurance extension and the §31א 12-month and 3-month warning duty.
- [x] Karnit (קרנית), the road-accident-victims fund: pays BODILY-injury compensation when you cannot claim from an insurer, in a hit-and-run / untraced driver case, an uninsured at-fault vehicle, or an at-fault insurer in liquidation (PLATD §12; §10 and §11 only establish and incorporate the fund). The operative gate is §12(א)'s `ואין בידו לתבוע פיצויים מאת מבטח`: a victim who has an insurer of their own, including an occupant of an insured vehicle hit by an untraced driver, cannot use Karnit.
- [x] When police involvement is mandatory: injuries or death (תקנה 144 plus the Traffic Ordinance Section 64א duty to stop and render aid) and hit-and-run. The אישור משטרתי (police confirmation) is a precondition for filing the insurance claim. The gov.il online "light accident" report applies only when there are no injuries, or injured persons were treated and released within 24 hours.

- [x] תשלום תכוף (PLATD §5 and §5א to §5ז): the 60-day demand, the court application, the 12% late interest, the 2-year ceiling, the 6-month bar on repeat applications, and the fact that the decision is not res judicata.
- [x] Compensation heads: the כאב וסבל formula (0.2% of the maximum per hospital day, 1% per disability point, 1% per year of age over 30 off the disability component, 10% cap with neither, 25% to the estate on death), the 3x-average-wage earnings cap and its pro-rating, and the 25% cap on the tax gross-down. The CPI-linked maximum's shekel value is deliberately NOT stated.
- [x] Statutory lawyer's fee cap (PLATD §16(א)): 8% of an agreed sum, 13% where there were legal proceedings, overpayment refundable.
- [x] Exclusivity of the cause of action (PLATD §8): no tort claim for bodily injury against the other driver, and the §7-excluded person is barred from tort too.
- [x] The court-appointed medical expert (PLATD §6א), and the §6ב trap whereby a disability percentage fixed under any other law before the evidence stage binds the PLATD claim.
- [x] Work-accident overlap: claim from both, no Bituach Leumi subrogation against the motor insurer, the benefit is netted off the award (חוק הביטוח הלאומי §328א(ב)), and the ועדה רפואית route.
- [x] Electric bikes and scooters fall outside PLATD; fallbacks are negligence or דמי תאונה לנפגעי תאונות אישיות.
- [x] The gov.il classification trap: a report filed without medical documents is classified as damage-only, not a road accident.
- [x] Absolute liability with no contributory-negligence reduction (§2(ג)), and who pays the medical bills (§2(ב1), §12(ב)).
- [x] Property damage falls outside PLATD entirely; the §8 bar does not reach it.
- [x] Scene duties beyond detail-exchange: the parked-vehicle written note plus 24-hour police report (תקנה 145(ג)), clearing the road (תקנה 145(ב)), and the passing driver's duty to render aid (תקנה 146).

## Should cover (advanced / edge cases)

- [x] Two subrogation regimes kept apart: PLATD §9 is a BAR on recourse with three exceptions (a §7-excluded person, an uninsured person minus the 30-day lapsed-policy grace, and the §7א permitting owner), while property recourse runs on Insurance Contract Law §62. Insurance Contract Law Section 62(a): the not-at-fault driver claims from their own comprehensive, pays the deductible (השתתפות עצמית), the insurer recovers from the at-fault party, and the deductible is refunded once the at-fault insurer pays in full.
- [x] Total loss (אובדן להלכה): when repair cost exceeds a threshold share of the vehicle's value, the insurer pays the vehicle's worth instead of repairing.
- [x] Diminished value, rental and loss-of-use: recovering the post-repair value drop and a replacement vehicle from the at-fault party.
- [x] Disputes and escalation: complaint to the Public Inquiries Unit at רשות שוק ההון, ביטוח וחיסכון (does not bar court), and small claims court for smaller property disputes (route to israeli-small-claims-court).

## Out of scope (explicit, with rationale)

- Vehicle registration, test, used-car checks, ownership transfer, choosing insurance, related skill: israeli-vehicle-manager handles these and explicitly excludes accidents. Cross-link, do not duplicate.
- Serious bodily-injury litigation: state the legal fact that PLATD bodily-injury claims (especially with permanent disability assessed by a court-appointed מומחה רפואי under §6א) typically require a lawyer; the skill helps document and understand rights but does NOT replace a lawyer. Do not frame as "no lawyer needed".
- DUI and criminal proceedings: the Section 64א criminal duty-to-stop offense and any criminal track are out of scope (mention the duty exists, do not advise on criminal defense).
- Driver's-license matters (points, suspension, renewals).
