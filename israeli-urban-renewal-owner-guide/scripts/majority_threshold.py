"""Report the STATUTORY majority threshold for an Israeli urban renewal track.

This prints published thresholds and, optionally, plain arithmetic against a signature
count the user supplies. It does NOT decide whether any owner's refusal is reasonable,
does NOT determine that anyone is a "dayar sarvan", and does NOT value anything. Those
questions are for the court (pinui-binui) or the mefake'ach (strengthening track), on
evidence, and for the owner's own advocate.

Pure local logic. No network, no third-party packages.
