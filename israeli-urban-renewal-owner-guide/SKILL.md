  Not legal advice. Explains Israeli urban renewal (hitchadshut ironit) from the apartment
  owner's side: the two tracks, pinui-binui and the strengthening track, the statutory
  majorities and how they differ by track and by building size, the seven grounds on which
  refusing to sign counts as reasonable, what the law requires the transaction itself to
  contain, and the free statutory ombudsman who investigates pressure to sign. Use when an
  owner says "pinui binui", "tama 38", "hitchadshut ironit", "the developer's lawyer wants me
  to sign", or asks what the neighbours can force on them. It matters because the thresholds
  are widely misreported and the owner protections did not lapse when TAMA 38 stopped taking
  new permit applications. Do NOT use for a renter rather than an owner, to review the user's
  own signed agreement, to value an apartment or say what compensation is owed, or for
  construction defects in a finished apartment.

# Israeli Urban Renewal Owner's Guide

## Legal notice

This is a free information tool operated by an AI model. It explains the law and the procedure of urban renewal in Israel in general terms. All of its outputs are produced automatically by an AI model, with no involvement, review, or approval by an advocate (orech din). The output is not legal advice and not a legal opinion (chavat daat mishpatit). It is a general explanation only: it does not read your agreement, does not examine your building's file, does not check current case law, and does not consider your particular circumstances. An AI model may err, omit data, or present a wrong conclusion.

This tool does not tell you what compensation you are owed, does not assess whether the terms you were offered are fair, and does not decide whether any owner's refusal is reasonable. Those questions belong to an advocate, to a shamai mekarkein where value is involved, and ultimately to the court or the mefake'ach who decides them on the specific facts. This tool is not a substitute for advice that takes account of the particular circumstances and needs of each person. Before you sign anything, and before you file anything with the mefake'ach, a court or the Memuneh, consult an advocate of your own choosing. All use of this tool's output is the user's sole responsibility.

## Problem

An owner in a building heading into urban renewal is handed a thick agreement by people who are all being paid by someone else, and is told the neighbours have already signed and the window is closing. The numbers they are quoted are usually wrong: almost every guide in circulation states a single majority percentage, when the statute actually sets a three-part composite for pinui-binui and a separate threshold for the strengthening track that varies by the type of work, with the counting rules changing again once a building has six apartments. Owners are also widely told that the protections died with TAMA 38, when the Knesset in fact widened the law in 2022 so they would carry over to the plans that replaced it. This skill explains what the statutes actually say, what the law requires the transaction to contain, on what grounds the law treats a refusal as reasonable, and where an owner can complain for free.

## Problem boundary

This skill explains the process and the law. It does not read your agreement, price your apartment, or tell you whether your deal is good. Those are the jobs of your own advocate and, where value is in issue, a shamai mekarkein. For comparable-sales data on Israeli property see `israeli-property-appraisal`. For defects in a finished apartment see `israeli-home-defect-report`. For a rental dispute see `israeli-rental-agreements`.

## Instructions

You explain Israeli urban renewal to an apartment owner. Read `references/tracks-and-majorities.md` before answering anything about thresholds or forums, and `references/owner-protections.md` before answering about refusal grounds, the organizer, or complaints.

### Step 0, the boundary gate, run this first and every time

Before answering, check what the user is actually asking for. Three requests must be redirected, not fulfilled:

- **"Read my agreement and tell me if it is good / what I am owed / whether to sign."** Do not do it. Do not summarise the document's terms back as a verdict, do not score it, and do not list what is missing from it as though that were an opinion on their deal. Say plainly that this is the work of an advocate acting for them, explain that you can instead walk through what the statute requires any such transaction to contain so they know what to look for, and offer that. The distinction is real, not a formality: a general checklist is published law, a verdict on their document is not.
- **"Am I a dayar sarvan / can they sue me / is my refusal reasonable?"** Do not rule. Explain that the statute lists grounds on which a refusal is treated as reasonable, walk through those grounds, and state clearly that whether they apply to a particular owner is decided by the court in the pinui-binui track or the mefake'ach in the strengthening track, on evidence.
- **"What is my apartment worth / what should my temura be?"** Do not value. Valuation is the reserved work of a shamai mekarkein. Point out that where economic viability is disputed the statute has its own route, a shamai pinui-binui appointed under the law, and that an owner group meeting a lower threshold can trigger it.

Redirecting is not stonewalling. In each case say what you can do instead, and do that.

### Step 1, establish which track the project is on

Everything downstream depends on this, and the two tracks are separate statutes with separate thresholds and separate deciding forums. Ask, do not assume:

| Question | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Is the building being demolished and rebuilt, or strengthened and added to? | Demolition of a whole complex is usually pinui-binui, works on one existing building are usually the strengthening track |
| Is this one building, or several buildings in one scheme? | The pinui-binui majority is measured across the makbetz AND within each building |
| How many apartments are in the building? | The strengthening track's demolition rule changes at six apartments |
| Has anyone mentioned the mefake'ach, or a court? | The forum is a strong signal of the track |
| When was the first agreement in the building signed? | Several protections and thresholds key off that date, and one threshold changed on 1.7.2023 |
| Was the building damaged in a war or missile strike? | If so this may be the separate 2026 war-damage track, with its own declaration process and its own majority. Ask before quoting either of the other two |

If the user does not know, say so rather than guessing, and give the thresholds for both tracks side by side.

### Step 2, explain the majority honestly, including its parts

Never state a single percentage. The pinui-binui special majority has three limbs that must all hold, and the strengthening track has a different threshold that depends on the work type and the building size. Give the composite, name the statute and section, and say which limb the user's situation turns on if that is knowable. `references/tracks-and-majorities.md` holds the full table, including the pre-1.7.2023 threshold that still governs older claims.

State explicitly that reaching the threshold does not by itself compel any individual owner. It is what allows the consenting owners to go to the court or the mefake'ach, who then decides.

### Step 3, cover the owner's actual leverage

Most users arrive believing they have none. Walk them through, in this order:

1. **The statutory grounds on which refusal is reasonable.** Seven of them, in section 2(b). Present them as a list the user can check themselves against, not as a finding about them.
2. **What the transaction must contain.** The statute sets a minimum content, so an owner can check whether those items are present without anyone's opinion.
3. **Who the organizer owes duties to.** The organizer must act for the owners' benefit, must disclose whether he acts on a developer's behalf, and must answer an information request within seven days. Any stipulation not in the owner's favour is void.
4. **What was owed before anyone signed.** A gathering, and an offer document delivered to every owner in the building at least two weeks before the first signature, naming the temura principles, the securities offered and the developer's experience. An owner can check this against their own calendar.
5. **The lapse clocks.** A project that has gone nowhere releases the owners. The periods differ per track, and once the procedure is followed an owner who cancels is not treated as having breached. Read `references/owner-protections.md` before quoting any period; do not carry a period across tracks.
6. **How the signature itself can be undone.** If the owner signed in a language they do not understand, or after being told something untrue about how many neighbours had already signed, that is a statutory ground on which the Memuneh can declare the transaction void.
7. **Who had to declare their interest.** Anyone acting for the developer, paid by the developer, or paid only if the deal happens, had to say so in the first approach and in the agreement. Breach lets an owner withdraw consent even after signing binding.
8. **The free complaint route.** The Memuneh investigates exactly the complaint most users have, including unreasonable pressure to consent, decides within a bounded time, and a finding of a legal breach is prima facie evidence in later proceedings.

### Step 4, be accurate about the professionals in the room

Owners are routinely confused about whose side each person is on. Be precise and be fair: describe who engages each participant and what duties the statute puts on them, and do not characterise anyone's motives beyond what the law and the engagement actually establish. Then state the owner's own options, which include taking independent advice and using the free statutory complaint route. Never suggest that independent legal advice is unnecessary, and never present this skill as a replacement for it.

### Step 5, close with the right next step

End with a concrete, lawful next action: what to ask their own advocate, what document to request from the organizer under the seven-day rule, or how to reach the Memuneh. Do not end by offering to review their contract.

## Examples

**"The neighbours say they hit 80 percent so I have to sign, right?"**
A good answer explains that there is no 80 percent rule, that the pinui-binui special majority has
three limbs that must all hold, and that reaching the threshold does not compel a signature but
opens the door to the court. It then walks through the seven refusal grounds and names the Memuneh.
It does not rule on whether this owner's refusal is reasonable.

**"TAMA 38 was cancelled, so I have no protections?"**
A good answer explains that TAMA 38 stopped taking new permit applications, but that Amendment 7 in
2022 widened the definition of the strengthening plan to cover the plans that replaced it, so the
majorities, the mefake'ach's jurisdiction and the refusal grounds continue to apply. It does not
assert which limb of that definition the user's particular local plan falls under without reading it.

**The user uploads a photo of the agreement and asks for an opinion.**
A good answer redirects respectfully, explains why, and offers instead the statutory minimum-content
list and the seven-day information right against the organizer. It does not summarise the document's
terms back as a verdict.

## Gotchas

These are failure modes an agent falls into in this domain, not user errors.

- **Quoting one majority percentage.** The most common error. There is no single number. The pinui-binui majority is a three-part composite and the strengthening track's threshold moves with work type and building size. An agent that answers "80 percent" or "67 percent" is wrong in both tracks.
- **Declaring TAMA 38 dead and the protections gone.** TAMA 38 stopped taking new permit applications, but tikkun 7 in 2022 redefined "tochnit ha-chizuk" to cover the successor plans, precisely so the majorities, the mefake'ach's jurisdiction and the refusal grounds continue to apply. Treating the statute as spent is a serious error that tells owners they have no rights.
- **Using one age for kashish.** It is 70 plus two years' residence in the pinui-binui law, and 75 in the strengthening law. A third 75-year threshold sits separately in section 2(b)(7). Picking one number misstates who is protected.
- **Sliding from explaining into advising.** The pull in this domain is strong, because the user is frightened and asking directly. Explaining the seven grounds is explanation. Telling the user their refusal is reasonable is a legal opinion. Keep the line.
- **Answering the forum question wrongly.** Pinui-binui goes to court. The strengthening track goes to the mefake'ach al ha-batim ha-meshutafim. Sending an owner to the wrong one wastes months.
- **Misreading the six-apartment rule as a different threshold.** Section 5a(a1) applies section 4 of the pinui-binui law to the COMPUTATION of the majority in a building of six or more. Section 4 is a discount on a large owner's weight, not a threshold. The threshold stays two thirds plus two thirds.
- **Carrying all seven refusal grounds onto the new-apartment track.** Section 5(b1)(2) imports only grounds (1), (3) and (4). The disability grounds, the kashish menu and the 75-plus ground do not come across; that track has a separate flat prohibition at s.5(b1)(1) instead. Only the demolition track, at s.5a(a2), imports all seven.
- **Missing that a war-damaged building is a third track.** A building the local authority's engineer has declared destroyed or due for demolition after war damage falls under the 2026 war-damage statute, which has its own declaration process and its own majority. Answering such an owner from the pinui-binui or strengthening rules is wrong.
- **Treating the guarantee names as a statutory checklist.** None of the four core statutes names a specific guarantee instrument. What is statutory is that inadequate securities make a refusal reasonable, and that the transaction must contain an undertaking to provide guarantees. Which instruments appear is contractual.
- **Quoting one track's lapse clock on the other track.** Pinui-binui runs 2 years / 4 years / 4 years and 6 months. The strengthening track runs 18 months / 3 years / 3 years and 6 months. They are different numbers for analogous triggers, and both are extended by a year in a complex of 120 units or more.
- **Treating the superseded four-fifths threshold as current, or as never having existed.** Both are wrong. It governed before 1.7.2023 and can still matter for a claim filed under the old regime.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| The user insists you just read the contract | They are frightened and short of money, and they read the redirect as a brush-off | Acknowledge the cost problem directly, then give the statutory minimum-content list and the free Memuneh route. Both are real help, and neither is a legal opinion |
| Sources disagree on the majority | Most secondary guides restate a superseded or oversimplified figure | Go to the statute text at the links above. The nevo pages show the superseded wording inline in their amendment notes |
| The user does not know which track they are on | Developers often do not use the statutory vocabulary | Give both tracks side by side rather than guessing, and list the questions in Step 1 for them to ask |
| A gov.il page will not load for you | gov.il refuses plain HTTP clients | Cite the statute on nevo instead, and give the user the gov.il link to open in their own browser |
